## Hi there!!

<!--
🌿 I'm Karoline Azevedo, a biologist working as a biodiversity and conservation researcher, currently finishing my PhD 🎓.
My work explores knowledge shortfalls, macroecology, and human-nature interactions, with a focus on protected areas and environmental perception 🌍.
I'm also a passionate science communicator and environmental educator, bringing ecology and conservation closer to young audiences and the broader public 📢🌱. Currently, I'm studying how people engage with National Parks in Sub-Saharan Africa.

I'm always open to discussions and collaborations—feel free to reach out! 📬 [karolineakaf@gmail.com]
