Hi there!! 🌿 I'm Karoline Azevedo, a biologist and biodiversity and conservation researcher, currently completing my PhD 🎓.
My research focuses on knowledge shortfalls, macroecology, and human-nature interactions, with a special interest in protected areas and environmental perception 🌍.
I'm also a passionate science communicator and environmental educator ✨, bringing ecology and conservation closer to young audiences and the broader public 📢🌱. Currently, I'm studying how people engage with National Parks in Sub-Saharan Africa. I'm looking forward to collaborating and exchanging ideas... 🤓 Get in touch! 📬 karolineakaf [at] gmail.com
